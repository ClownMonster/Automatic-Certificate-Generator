# Automatic-Certificate-Generator

### Current Status
  1. The project has a working python script(Contributor: Shashank N), which generates certificates for all the names in an ExcelSheet.
 
### Developments Required.

  1. We aim to expect a fully functioning web app, that exposes the above script as an API using flask/Django.
  2. Basically,the contributor, has to develop a working GUI that takes inputs like certificate template, Font_Size,CSV_file etc. as form inputs.
  
### What is there in store for you ?
  
  1. Chance to demonstrate your project on IEEE Website Blog (With credits given)
  2. Feeling like a developer in real life :P
